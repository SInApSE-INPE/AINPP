# AI Nowcasting Pilot Project (AINPP)

## Project Overview

The **AI Nowcasting Pilot Project (AINPP)** is a global initiative led by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Its primary goal is to **accelerate the development and application of effective nowcasting (very short-range forecasting) systems based on Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, especially in developing countries.

This project aims to enhance the forecasting of severe weather phenomena, providing more accurate and timely early warnings to save lives and reduce socio-economic losses. The AINPP is aligned with the United Nations' global **"Early Warning for All" (EW4All)** initiative, seeking to strengthen global climate resilience through technological innovation.

## Key Objectives of AINPP

As described on the ASoftwareLab platform, the main objectives of the project include:

* **Evaluating AI Effectiveness:** To determine the effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence in very short-term weather forecasting.
* **Implementing Experimental Products:** To deploy experimental AI-driven nowcasting products, with an initial focus on tropical regions.
* **Establishing Best Practices:** To define and promote best practices for the use of AI in nowcasting.
* **Promoting Collaboration:** To encourage collaboration between public and private sectors in the field of weather forecasting.
* **Supporting EW4All:** To actively contribute to the UN's "Early Warning for All" initiative.
* **Strengthening Resilience:** To advance technological innovation to strengthen climate resilience worldwide.

## How It Works & Technology

The AINPP nowcasting system utilizes a combination of:

* **Real-time Data:**
    * Weather radar
    * Satellite imagery
* **Machine Learning Algorithms:** To process the data and generate very short-term forecasts of imminent weather events.

## Expected Impact

The project aims to:

* Provide **timely and early warnings**.
* **Save lives**.
* **Reduce socio-economic losses** associated with severe weather events.

## Target Audience

The information and outcomes of the AINPP are aimed at:

* **National Meteorological Services (NMSs)**
* **Academic Institutions**
* **Industry Leaders**

## Context and Relevance

The AINPP is presented as a response to the urgent need for more effective early warning systems, leveraging advancements in Artificial Intelligence to improve the forecasting capabilities for extreme weather events, which are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change.
