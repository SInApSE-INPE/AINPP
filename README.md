# AI Nowcasting Pilot Project (AINPP)

[![WMO Logo](https://community.wmo.int/themes/custom/wmo_bootstrap/logo.svg)](https://wmo.int/)  **A global initiative by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to advance severe weather forecasting through Artificial Intelligence.**

## Overview

The AI Nowcasting Pilot Project (AINPP) represents a pioneering effort to integrate cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques into operational nowcasting systems. Nowcasting, the detailed forecasting of weather for the immediate future (typically 0-6 hours), is critical for issuing timely warnings for high-impact weather events such as severe thunderstorms, heavy precipitation, and flash floods. AINPP aims to accelerate the adoption and operationalization of AI-based nowcasting tools, with a particular focus on enhancing the capabilities of National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs), especially in developing countries.

This initiative directly supports the [United Nations' Early Warnings for All (EW4All)](https://www.undrr.org/early-warnings-for-all) initiative, striving to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected by early warning systems.

## Mission & Objectives

The core mission of AINPP is to **save lives and reduce socio-economic losses** by improving the accuracy, lead time, and accessibility of severe weather forecasts through the application of AI.

Key objectives include:

* **Evaluating AI Efficacy:** Systematically assess the performance and reliability of various AI algorithms for nowcasting diverse meteorological phenomena.
* **Operational Deployment:** Facilitate the deployment and testing of experimental AI-driven nowcasting products, initially focusing on tropical regions which are often data-sparse and highly vulnerable.
* **Best Practices & Standardization:** Develop and disseminate guidelines, best practices, and standards for the ethical and effective use of AI in nowcasting.
* **Capacity Building:** Enhance the technical capacity of NMHSs to develop, implement, and maintain AI-based nowcasting systems.
* **Fostering Collaboration:** Promote and strengthen collaboration between public sector meteorological services, academic and research institutions, and private sector innovators.
* **Technological Advancement:** Drive innovation in AI applications for weather forecasting to build global climate resilience.

## Features & Technology

AINPP leverages a combination of meteorological data sources and advanced computational techniques:

* **Input Data:**
    * Real-time weather radar data (e.g., reflectivity, Doppler velocity)
    * Geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite imagery (e.g., visible, infrared, water vapor channels)
    * Surface weather observations
    * Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model outputs
* **Core Technology:**
    * **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Deep learning models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks - CNNs, Recurrent Neural Networks - RNNs, Generative Adversarial Networks - GANs, Transformers) for spatiotemporal forecasting.
    * **Data Fusion Techniques:** Methods to optimally combine information from diverse data sources.
    * **High-Performance Computing (HPC):** Utilized for training complex AI models and running operational nowcasting systems.
* **Output Products:**
    * Short-term (0-6 hours) probabilistic and deterministic forecasts of precipitation intensity, storm track, lightning potential, and other severe weather parameters.
    * Visually intuitive forecast products for dissemination to forecasters and end-users.

## Target Audience

The primary stakeholders and beneficiaries of the AINPP include:

* **National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs):** For operational forecasting and warning dissemination.
* **Disaster Management Agencies:** For preparedness and response activities.
* **Academic and Research Institutions:** For advancing scientific understanding and developing new AI methodologies.
* **Private Sector Weather Companies:** For value-added service development and innovation.
* **General Public and Vulnerable Communities:** As the ultimate beneficiaries of improved early warnings.
